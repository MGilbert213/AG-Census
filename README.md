# Census of Agriculture 2022 #
These are the script files I used to prepare and upload Ag census data from the USDA. The raw data were processed in ArcGIS Pro several Python scripts were used to prepare and publish the data to AGOL. 

The other script was used, along with the data file, to create views from the hosted feature layer; one view for each commodity of interest.
